# Belly_Button Dashboard


This project included extensive data on different subjects identified by an ID number.  It was recorded how many times they washed their belly button and then later the different types of bacteria grown from a culture of their umbilicus.  

From that data, a dashboard was built.  A drop down menu was built with the different ID numbers of each subject.  When the number is changed a bar graph is created representing the bacteria found in that subjects belly button.  It was put in reverse order and grouped by OTU ids.  OTU ids represented the type of bacteria.  

Another group of information shown with the subject ID, was a bubble chart.  The bubble size represented how many of each bacteria with the OTU id as well.  The last thing was a gauge built to show how many times the subject washed their umbilicus.

In the last deliverable the web page was personalized.  The web page is mobile responsive, an image was added to the jumbotron of bacteria, the font in the jumbotron was changed as well as the color.
